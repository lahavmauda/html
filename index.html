    <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
    <p><b>Production Manager ,</b> with proven experience in streamlining production processes and improving work procedures.<br> Skilled in inventory management, quality improvement, safety programs, and maintenance planning.</p>

    <h3><b>Key Achievements</b></h3>
    <p>Headed a team in streamlining the operation of a low pressure molding machine for casting melted plastic into solenoid products.</p>

    <p>Previous to implementing my technique, the process of producing solenoids was manual and involved several labor-intensive steps.<br> The solenoids were arranged by a two-man team on two round tables, with each table holding 450 units, totaling in 900 units that could be produced per day.<br> Afterward, the worker would prepare the manual injection molding machine and manually inject melted plastic into each solenoid cup individually.<br> The process of arranging the solenoids on the table took one and a half hours  and injecting the melted plastic into the cups took about 3 hours.<br> Additionally, the drying time for the solenoids on the tables was 24 hours.<br>Only after this drying period could the solenoids be removed from the table and moved on to the next step â€“ data printing on the solenoid.</p>
    
    <p>After experimentaion and brainstorming, my team and I developed methods to convert the machine to semi-automatic as opposed to its previous manual state.<br We also streamlined the process to only require one worker to operate the machine.<br>Currently, the casting time for two solenoids is 15 seconds, including drying.<br> The maximum production capacity in an 8-hour workday is 3,840 units.</p>

    <p>We successfully increased production output by approximately 326% compared to the manual method.<br> We also observed a significant decrease in defective units, with a reduction of about 68%.<br> Additionally, there was a significant improvement in labor efficiency, as the process now requires only one worker instead of two, as was the case with the manual method.</p> <br> My team and I were later invited to a factory in Reno, Nevada to check the compatability of the machine we improved.

    <h3>An unforgettable journey.</h3>
    <a href="gallery.html" target='_blank'>Click here to experience the beauty of the African continent</a>

    <p>In 2003, I traveled across Africa, visiting 10 countries with two close friends and three companions.<br> Most of the journey was spent in rural areas, places rarely visited by individuals from more developed cultures.<br> It was precisely this unique aspect of the trip that allowed us to naturally immerse ourselves in the local culture, gaining a deeper understanding of the daily lives of the people and the challenges they face in contrast to the modernity we come from.<br> I accumulated countless fascinating insights and lessons from every place I visited.</p>

    <p>The nature that unfolded before me instilled a deep sense of peace and gratitude.<br> No photograph I took or words I could express would ever capture the awe-inspiring wonder that lay before us.</p>

    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
    <p>I enjoy scuba diving, snowboarding, traveling to off-the-beaten-path destinations, and discovering the best cozy spots for quality coffee (herbal tea works great too!).<br> Volunteering is another passion of mine. Currently, I volunteer in various fields, including healthcare and supporting children with cancer. <br> I served as Deputy Head of the Yokneam branch of Ichud Hatzalah for 10 years. <br In the past, I would visit nursing homes with my dog. <br> Volunteering gives me the motivation to help, succeed, and see life through different perspectives.</p>

    <h3>So why am I here? Why am I learning QA?</h3>
    <p>I come from the industrial sector, and for some time now, I've been searching for the best way to transition into the high-tech field and modern professions.<br> After extensive research into several areas in tech, I concluded that the field I naturally connect with is automation.<br> The main reasons that led me to choose this field are my ability to influence the process to improve product quality, ensuring that the customer receives the product they requested without errors and bugs, and being an integral part of the team developing the product.</p>

    <h3>Why am I suited for QA?</h3>
    <p>In my opinion, I am well-suited for the field of automation due to my ability to identify and solve problems, skills I have acquired over 20 years in the industry.<br> My attention to detail and my analytical approach to identifying problems in the process are what guide me to be successful in any project I undertake.<br> I also enjoy working in a team and being part of a system committed to ensuring quality and continuous product improvement.</p>
