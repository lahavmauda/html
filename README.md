# HTML Practice Project

## 🧠 Project overview
This repository is a small sandbox for practicing basic HTML structure,  
testing elements, and experimenting with layouts.

## 🧩 Purpose
To get comfortable with the fundamentals of web structure,  
so I can better understand what I’m testing when working with web applications.

## 🛠️ Tools and methods
- HTML and simple CSS  
- Local browser testing  
- GitHub for version control and sharing

## 💡 What I practiced
- Forms, buttons, and input elements  
- Page structure and nesting  
- Linking pages and navigation  
- Working with semantic tags

## 📘 Next steps
Use this repo as a base for learning small JavaScript interactions  
and exploring front-end automation tests later on.
